Reversi242
==========

Reversi.java - main methods for the game

ReversiBoard.java- methods for game board, not really important for us TA's

Sockets.java- important socketing information, takes port number as constructor parameter, generally
	white player listens on port 4444
	black player listents on port 5555

SampleClient.java- a simple java client that can spit moves read from stdio to the main program, needs a port to listen on as a parameter (see above for conventions)

runGame.sh- quick script that runs the game all at once. Doesn't work right now because the client programs are terrible
